/*!
 * GetInstance():This is the so-called Singleton design pattern.
 * Its distinguishing feature is that there can only ever be exactly one
 * instance of that class and the pattern ensures that. The class has a private
 * constructor and a statically-created instance that is returned with the
 * GetInstance method. You cannot create an instance from the outside and thus
 * get the object only through said method.Since instance is static in the
 * GetInstance method it will retain its value between multiple invocations. It
 * is allocated and constructed some where before it's first used. E.g. in this
 * answer it seems like GCC initializes the static variable at the time the
 * function is first used.
