# RTM-Framework
This is a modularized structure for the RTM, this doesn't interface with any other framework and only provides interfaces and Null Concrete Implementations and documentation of the interfaces and API of the different RTM components.

It also provides the implementation of the engine that will use the components for the full RTM cycle. This should be used as a base for any RTM oriented variation.
