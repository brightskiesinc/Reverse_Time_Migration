# Boundary Managers
All different implementations of the boundary manager interface should reside here. Description of the different implementations should be below.
## Perfect Refection(No Boundary Condition)
* Component Class : NoBoundaryManager
* Utilizes perfect reflection boundaries(0 velocity in boundaries).
* Supports : 2D & 3D, Full Model and Window Model.
## Random Boundaries
* Component Class : RandomBoundaryManager
* Utilizes random boundaries(defines a random but smooth transition to the velocities in the boundaries).
* Supports : 2D & 3D, Full Model and Window Model.
